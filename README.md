# Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Enhancing Privacy in Cryptographic Protocols


Welcome to the Zero-Knowledge Proofs GitHub repository! Here, we explore the fascinating concept of zero-knowledge proofs and their potential in enhancing privacy and security within cryptographic protocols.

## About
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are cryptographic protocols that enable one party to demonstrate knowledge of certain information to another party without revealing any details about the information itself. This repository aims to shed light on the applications and benefits of zero-knowledge proofs in the field of cybersecurity.
